### Coaches
#### Ray Lucchesi 
Over 40 years in IT industry developing testing and managing systems for enterprise data centers. I have been a consultant to systems and storage vendors for over 15 years and have spent the last 4 years being assistent coach of PRA FTC Robotics team.  

Since I watched the Apollo Moon Landings live in the 60s until today I have always wanted to be involved in space. And now with the advent of Cubesats and NASA's public-private partnership to develop space infrastructure, I feel there has been no better time to get involved and help humanity reach for the stars.
