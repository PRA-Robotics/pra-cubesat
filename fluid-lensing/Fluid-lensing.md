# This directory is intended to hold information on Fluid Lensing as developed at Stanford/NASA
Ultimately we would like to use cubesat, drone, boat to use this technology to provide better underwater images but from above ground cameras. 

All this of course running on RPi. 

- The NASA website that shows their [Fluid Lensing Technology](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/las/fluid-lensing-overview)
- The Dr. Ved Chirayath's Stanford dissertation on the [Fluid Lensing technology](https://purl.stanford.edu/kw062mg5196) haven't found this directly available yet but perhaps if one of us contacted the good Dr. he'd send us a PDF of it
- NASA Dr. Ved's US patent application on [Fluid Lensing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190266712A1/en) from Google Patents
- [Google Scholar articles by Dr. Ved](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=es6W-oIAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Link to a [youtube video describing the tech](https://youtu.be/kdp-xDRiDQY)
